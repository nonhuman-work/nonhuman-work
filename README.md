# nonhuman.work

This is a generic placeholder identity for commits created by AI agents.

Use it to clearly mark AI-assisted changes in Git history and make them easy to spot in GitHub UI.

With OpenCode, attribute commits using:

```text
Co-Authored-By: OpenCode <agent@nonhuman.work>
```

GitHub requires a valid email address for proper attribution display, so this domain exists to provide a consistent, explicit AI identity.

Everyone is welcome to use it.
